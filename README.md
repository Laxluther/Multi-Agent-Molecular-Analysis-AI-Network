# Multi-Agent Molecular Analysis AI Network

A sophisticated multi-agent system for molecular analysis and protein interaction studies using AI-powered agents.

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive multi-agent system for molecular analysis, featuring specialized AI agents that collaborate to analyze proteins, enzymes, interactions, safety considerations, and research outcomes. The system provides both programmatic access and a user-friendly Streamlit web interface.

## Features

### 🤖 Multi-Agent Architecture
- **Protein Analysis Agents**: Analyze protein structures, functions, and properties
- **Enzyme Analysis Agents**: Study enzyme kinetics and catalytic mechanisms
- **Interaction Analysis Agents**: Examine molecular interactions and binding
- **Safety Assessment Agents**: Evaluate toxicity and safety considerations
- **Research Coordination Agents**: Orchestrate research workflows and reporting

### 🔬 Molecular Analysis Tools
- Protein structure analysis and visualization
- Enzyme kinetics calculations
- Molecular interaction studies
- Toxicity assessment and safety evaluation
- Comprehensive reporting and documentation

### 🌐 Web Interface
- Streamlit-based user interface
- Interactive molecular analysis workflows
- Real-time agent coordination
- Results visualization and export

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Laxluther/Multi-Agent-Molecular-Analysis-AI-Network.git
cd Multi-Agent-Molecular-Analysis-AI-Network
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables (if required):
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

## Usage

### Web Interface
Run the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### Programmatic Access
```python
from orchestrator import MolecularAnalysisOrchestrator

# Initialize the orchestrator
orchestrator = MolecularAnalysisOrchestrator()

# Run molecular analysis
results = orchestrator.analyze_molecule(molecule_data)
```

## Configuration
